# Instructions for Project Workflow

## 1. Preparing Training Images
1. Save the training images in the `/Images` folder.
2. Use an annotation tool (e.g., [LabelImg](https://github.com/heartexlabs/labelImg)) to label objects in the images.
3. Save the annotations in YOLO format in the same `/Images` folder.

## 2. Setting Up the Training Environment
Run the `setup_env.bat` file located in the `YoloModel` folder.

## 3. Starting the Model Training Process
Run the `run_train.ps1` script. Once the script is executed, the model will be ready.
